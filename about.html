        <h2>Meet the team</h2>
        <p class="lead">The non-governmental and non-profit organisation "Child and Environment" has over 25+ years of experience in various projects related to homeless children. The organisation created a shelter for children from the street. Since 1995 "Child & Environment" has provided counselling and courses for the creative and professional redevelopment of those children on an ongoing basis. By doing so, the "Child and Environment" organisation became well known in Georgia and abroad. Employees of the organisation have a track record of working with government bodies, commercial organisations, foundations, and projects to improve children's lives. </p>
        <p class="lead">During recent years the company, together with its' new coordinator Irina Mostitsca is focusing on Gentrification and eco-activities in the Capital of Georgia, Tbilisi. They already accomplished 2 projects financed by GEF for green Gentrification of six gardens in Tbilisi (3 yards and 3 school gardens) with great success. The idea of the 'Tbilisi New Yard' and "Learning Garden" projects was further developed and spread across dozens of yards and school gardens by the local district administration. Project "Learning Garden" was especially needed for children from disadvantaged families. </p>
